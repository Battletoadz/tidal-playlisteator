## Configuration

The script supports both `.env` and `.ini` configuration files. Choose one method:

### Option 1: Using conf.env (recommended)

Edit your existing `conf.env` file:

```env
TIDAL_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
TIDAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret
PLAYLIST_NAME=My Awesome Playlist
TRACKLIST_URLS=https://www.1001tracklists.com/tracklist/example1.html,https://www.1001tracklists.com/tracklist/example2.html
```

### Option 2: Using conf.ini

Edit the `conf.ini` file:

```ini
[tidal]
client_id = your_actual_client_id
client_secret = your_actual_client_secret
playlist_name = My Awesome Playlist

[tracklists]
urls = https://www.1001tracklists.com/tracklist/example1.html,https://www.1001tracklists.com/tracklist/example2.html
```

## üéõÔ∏è Available Versions

### ‚ö° SPEEDOPTIMIZED.py (Recommended)
- **Faster processing**: ~40% faster than stable version
- **Reduced delays**: 0.1-0.2s between requests
- **Higher match threshold**: 40% confidence for faster decisions
- **Best for**: Popular tracks, large playlists, when speed matters

### üêå STABLESLOW.py (Maximum Coverage)
- **Maximum track finding**: More thorough search strategies
- **Conservative delays**: 0.5-2s between requests  
- **Lower match threshold**: 30% confidence for broader matching
- **Best for**: Obscure tracks, small playlists, when quality > speed

## Usage

### Basic Usage (with configuration file)

```bash
python dev.py
```

### Command Line Arguments

You can override configuration file settings:

```bash
python dev.py --playlist-name "My Custom Playlist" --tracklist-urls https://www.1001tracklists.com/tracklist/example.html
```

### Show Browser Window (for debugging)

```bash
python dev.py --no-headless
```

### Create Sample Configuration Files

```bash
python dev.py --create-config
```

## Available Options

- `--client-id`: Tidal Client ID
- `--client-secret`: Tidal Client Secret  
- `--playlist-name`: Name for the Tidal playlist
- `--tracklist-urls`: Space-separated list of 1001tracklists URLs
- `--config-file`: Path to custom configuration file
- `--create-config`: Generate sample configuration files
- `--no-headless`: Show browser window (useful for debugging)

## How It Works

1. **Scraping**: The script uses Selenium to scrape track information from 1001tracklists.com
2. **Deduplication**: Removes duplicate tracks based on artist and title
3. **Tidal Integration**: Authenticates with Tidal using OAuth
4. **Playlist Creation**: Searches for each track on Tidal and adds found tracks to a new playlist

## Troubleshooting

### Browser Issues

- Make sure Firefox is installed
- Ensure geckodriver is in your PATH
- Try running with `--no-headless` to see what's happening

### Tidal Authentication

- Verify your Client ID and Client Secret are correct
- Make sure you complete the OAuth flow in your browser
- Check that your Tidal account has playlist creation permissions

### Track Not Found

- Some tracks may not be available on Tidal
- The script will report which tracks couldn't be found
- Track matching is done by searching "Artist - Title"

## üí° Tips & Tricks

- **Use descriptive playlist names** to organize your music library
- **Multiple tracklists**: The script automatically removes duplicates across all URLs
- **Missing tracks**: Some tracks may not be available on Tidal due to licensing
- **Retry failed tracks**: Run the script multiple times - different search strategies may find previously missed tracks
- **Rate limiting**: If you get "data" errors, use `STABLESLOW.py` for more conservative timing
- **Large playlists**: For 100+ tracks, consider running during off-peak hours
